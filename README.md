# Blocky
![Game](https://github.com/MellowYarker/Blocky/blob/master/block.jpg?raw=true "Example")
## Instructions
Instructions on how to play and how to win can be found in the game.

## Changing the game type
There are **four** game types:
* auto_game
* two_player_game
* solitaire_game
* sample_game

I haven't made a useful interface for setting up the game yet, so for now you'll need to open the game.py file and look at the 4 functions at the bottom of the file to get some intuition as to how the game runs.
I'd suggest looking at the arguments to initliaze a Game object. To run the game, uncomment the desired function call in the main block and run the game.py file
* By default the sample_game runs <br />
